              <div class="content active" id="panel2">
				Perhaps your prioritization of people with their own books to sell led to inadvertent systematic discrimination, as you were reliant on the discriminatory publishing world and more generally on people without significant non-work-related demands on their time. Since I was also disappointed in how much of the conference devolved into the speakers plugging their own books, I am confident you could kill two birds with one stone by instead seeking out the most qualified speakers.
			  </div>
			  <div class="content" id="panel3">
				Perhaps your selection process produced a skewed pool of potential speakers, but it is disappointing that when you saw that outcome you did not step back to consider which speakers were missing from your consideration.
			  </div>
			  <div class="content" id="panel4">
				Perhaps your inability to cover even conference expenses, much less compensate your speakers, led to only people with the support of a company being willing to parcipate, leaving you vulnerable to the discriminatory policies of those companies.  Even if you do not routinely cover expenses or provide compensation, consider reaching out directly to speakers that would enrich your program and offering to compensate them.
			  </div>
			  <div class="content" id="panel5">
				You should consider adopting an anti-harassment policy and reaching out to a more diverse group of potential speakers.  This could increase attendence, both because more people will feel comfortable attending but also because your attendees will have the opportunity to hear from the excellent speakers you have thus far obviously overlooked.

            <div class="text">This impression has a direct impact on your event.  When I was trying to build a group from <input type="text" style="display:inline; width: 300px; margin:0; padding:0 5px;" placeholder="Your Company or organization"/> to attend this event, it was difficult to generate interest among some people who would normally be enthusiastic about attending an event like this.  Without any <input data-type="marginalizedGroup" type="test" style="display:inline; width:300px;" placeholder="members of the marginalize group overlooked"/> speaking <select name="reallybad" style="display:inline; width:300px;"><option value="or even token efforts towards diversity" selected>or even token efforts towards diversity</option><option value=""></option></select>, there was no evidence that there would be other <span class="marginalizedGroup placeholder">members of the marginalized group</span> there or that the organizers of this event see <span class="marginalizedGroup placeholder">members of the marginalized group</span> as peers.  Experience has taught that this attitude is likely to be reflected in the attendees of your event, cultivating an atmosphere that supports microaggressions and potentially outright harassment.  It can also signal that any complaints about the conference or behavior of attendees will be brushed off as disruptive to the existing exclusionary atmosphere that it appears this event has cultivated.</div>
            <br/>
			<p class="text">Going forward, if I see another line up of all <span class="privilegedGroup placeholder">privileged Group</span> speaking at your conference, I will have to assume you are actively working to run a conference to alienate <span class="marginalizedGroup placeholder">members of the marginalized group</span>.  Since I’m not interested in that environment, this may be my last <span class="eventName placeholder">event name</span>; I could instead have attended <input type="text" style="display:inline; width: 500px; margin:0;" placeholder="Other conference that bothered to make an effort"/> where I know I and my peers would both have felt more welcome.</p>

			  I saw the announcement for <input data-type="eventName" type="text" style="display: inline; width: 300px;" placeholder="Event Name"/> and was interested in attending.  When I looked over the list of speakers I noticed there was a lack of speakers who are <input data-type="marginalizedGroup" type="test" style="display:inline; width:300px;" placeholder="marginalized demographic"/>.  This was disappointing because I find that having more voices sparks conversations and insights that wouldn’t happen without the presence of <input data-type="membersOfTheMarginalizedGroup" type="test" style="display:inline; width:300px;" placeholder="members of the marginalized group"/>.

				There are a variety of ways in which unintentional bias can lead to homogenous speakers at a conference. Mentioning diversity in calls for speakers, performing active outreach to marginalized groups, and encouraging new people to become speakers are all methods of increasing the effectiveness of recruitment.
